# Additive Questionnaire

Developed by  Petr Rossyakin and Alina Russkikh, the questionnaire is intended for use in fieldwork.

This repository contains a typological questionnaire for the description of additive markers (e.g., English *too*, German *auch*) across the world’s languages. The current version of the questionnaire consists of 81 stimuli that target 12 distinct functional domains of additive meaning:  
*additivity, scalar additivity, coordination, comitative, contrast, pragmatics, concessive clauses, compound numerals, numerative constructions with exhaustive meaning, quantifiers, distributivity, indefinite pronouns*.

## Purpose

The questionnaire aims to capture both the semantic and morphosyntactic variation of additive markers across languages. It is designed to support detailed field-based descriptions of additive constructions in individual languages as well as cross-linguistic comparison.

A function is included in the questionnaire if there is attested evidence from at least two unrelated languages that additive markers participate in it. In addition to well-attested functions, the questionnaire features a small number of hypothetical or marginal contexts (called *optional*) — cases where the use of additive markers is rare or predicted by typological patterns but remains underdescribed.

## Structure of the questionnaire

The questionnaire is organised into the following columns, each serving a specific purpose during elicitation:

- **ID**: A unique code assigned to each stimulus.  
- **Function**: Specifies the functional domain of additive meaning that the stimulus targets.  
- **Use**: Describes an additional semantic or morphosyntactic parameter relevant to the function.  
- **Example to ask**: What the consultant is asked during elicitation. This field includes the left context (if any) and the target sentence.  
- **Comment**: Notes and suggestions for the researcher. This column may highlight points needing clarification, potential ambiguities, or additional configurations that may be worth testing.
